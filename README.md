# Time Travel I am learning how to make a zine inside git repo. I will act as an author and editor for the branches and issues with PR.
## GItignore Patterns
-   IDE and OS files are ignored to avoid cluttering the repo with environment-specific settings.
-   Build artifacts are excluded since they can be regenerated from source code

## Branch workflow
-   'author/idea-sprint' : Author writes initi zine content and features.
-   'editor/review' : Editor performs edits, formatting, and copy polish before mergining main.
